> Development with [openwrt-lede](https://github.com/coolsnowwolf/lede) and [mentohust](https://github.com/tkkcc/mentohust)

To use this method you need to have some computer knowledge and some hands-on skills.

## Download
- [python source code](https://github.com/hz157/XMUTWirelessRouter/tree/python)
- [shell_script (ifname)](https://github.com/hz157/XMUTWirelessRouter/blob/script/script/shell_ifname.sh)
- [shell_script (device)](https://github.com/hz157/XMUTWirelessRouter/blob/script/script/shell_device.sh)

## Introduce
This method uses openwrt as the system, and uses MentoHUST developed by students of USTC for Ruijie authentication. <br>
Therefore, before using this method, you need to have the device and account described below
- A wireless router that supports openwrt system  [support list](https://github.com/hz157/XMUTWirelessRouter/blob/doc/doc/support_openwrt_list.md)
- Your student account (**Campus Ruijie account can only be logged in with a single device, and the campus wireless account and Ruijie authentication account are separate and will not be affected**)

If you happen to have the above two, congratulations, you will soon be able to enjoy the joy of dormitory wireless.

### Scripting Languages
